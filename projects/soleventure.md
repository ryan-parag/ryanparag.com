> SoleVenture makes insurance benefits and invoicing more accessible for freelancers by combining a business manager, insurance marketplace, company formation, accounting automation, and reporting all in one place.

I worked with [SoleVenture](https://www.soleventure.com/launch-and-grow) as their sole designer, establishing their brand identity and crafting an end-to-end user experience for a native mobile app, and later a web app. Today, SoleVenture is one of the fastest growing benefits platforms for freelancers and is helping new and old freelancers more meaningfully navigate the gig economy.

### Introduction

The easiest way to setup a business, access benefits, manage freelance income, and track business contracts.

When I first started working with SoleVenture, we focused on making it easier for freelancers to setup and manage their business. Most freelancers use a variety of apps/services in order to manage simple projects within their freelance business.

This can easily be a logistical nightmare, as freelancers might lapse in a certain area of their business when life gets in the way:

- losing a contract document
- forgetting to add an invoice under the business
- missing business insurance

As a result, many freelancers end up either overspending for separate services or dissuaded from freelancing altogether. SoleVenture helps freelancers manage their business by giving them a mobile and web dashboard to help manage the accounting and insurance for their small business.

### Setting up a Business ðŸ’¼

Onboarding new freelancers and setting up a new business can become fairly complex. Our goal was to make this process more transparent and simple - letting various other behind-the-scenes tasks perform the operational tasks involved when registering a new business.

### Shopping and Managing Insurance â›‘

One of the most painstaking processes for small business owners/freelancers usually centers around managing the gamut of insurance plans for their business, such as:

- Small Business Insurance
- Life Insurance
- Health Insurance
- Vision
- Retirement
- Dental

We needed to figure out how users could shop and manage each type of insurance, all within a single platform.

### Simple Invoice Management ðŸ§¾

Since most of the app's features center around a freelancer's income, it made sense to allow freelancers to also invoice their clients to the same platform - bringing cycle of income for a freelancer full circle within the SoleVenture app.

Users are able to create invoices, tie them to clients, and send them to contacts through email.

### Managing Taxes ðŸ’°

Figuring out what to pay and when to pay it can become a headache for freelancers. Incorporating a way to track quarterly tax statements and make the payment through IRS could help freelancers simplify their business management workflow.

### Scalable, Consistent Design ðŸŽ¨

We worked on crafting a design system early on in the process to:

1. Faster iteration with consistent design
2. Faster development with a reusable set of interface components
3. Clearer, more consistent experience for the user
