### Masonite M-Pwr Smart Doors

This project was complex, and as such, requires multiple teams to manage - we needed to build a door system that is directly powered from a home, as well as have a mobile app & IoT infrastructure to support the embedded features (multiple sensors, third-party cameras & locks, LED lightning, etc.). [Take a look!](https://residential.masonite.com/product/exterior-doors/smart/)

> Users need a way to manage and control a powered and connected door conveniently with their mobile phones and with their home automation applications.

### Door Configurator

The exterior door configurator is an app that allows our users to build a custom door and quickly assess their new door per their unique specifications.

After configuring a door, our contractor clients are able to add the item to a lead/quote under the core ordering platform for home builders and contractors.

> To identify numerous attributes of the customer experience to better understand the value and buying behaviors consumers and contractors associate with specifying, ordering, designing, finishing, delivering and installing door systems

### Core ordering platform for home builders

The core ordering platforms allows the various customers of Masonite to configure door systems from one of the many business units. Using qualitative research, market data, and iterative design methods, an application was created to help buyers (contractors, dealers, retailers, etc.) configure, quote, order and track their purchases.

> Help contractors, dealers, and distributors connect with homeowners, enable their sales teams, manage their orders, and gain insights into their business
